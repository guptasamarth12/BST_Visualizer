# BST_Visualizer
The goal of this project is to be able to visualize data in a Binary Search Tree (BST).

What's unique about BST's is that the value of the data in the left child node is less than the value in its parent node, and the value stored in the right child node is greater than the parent. This makes searching for a value more efficient than other searching methods (data stored in an array or linked list, for example). This project allows faculty to be able to graphically display Binary Search Trees while explaining them to students.
